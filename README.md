# secureUSB
Here you can find the code I used to secure the files on my USB device. 

The main function should be located in the same folder as the directory you want to secure. 

In the cryp file, you can edit the path to the file where the key is stored. Thus, it should not be stored with the main file, giving out the path to the key.
