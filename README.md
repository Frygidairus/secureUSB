# secureUSB
Here you can find the code I used to secure the files on my USB device. Please note that this version may be flawed. Use it carefully and only on files you are sure to have a copy somewhere.

The main function should be located in the same folder as the directory you want to secure. 

Prior to using this script, you should create a .txt file containing the salt you generated. A 16 bytes long salt should be enough. 
In the cryp file, you can edit the path to the file where the salt is stored.
